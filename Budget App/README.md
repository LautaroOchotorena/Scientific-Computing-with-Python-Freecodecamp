# Budget App

The **objective** is to make an interfance when making a budget.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Budget%20App/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**Budget**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Budget%20App/budget.py) is where I did the work.

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Budget%20App/main.py) runs the **budget file** and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Budget%20App/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.
