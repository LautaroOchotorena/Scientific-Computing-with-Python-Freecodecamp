# Probabily Calculator

The **objective** is to approximate probabilities doing experiments.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Probabily%20Calculator/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**Prob calculator**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Probabily%20Calculator/prob_calculator.py) is where I did the work.

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Probabily%20Calculator/main.py) runs the **prob calculator file** and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Probabily%20Calculator/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.

You can also **check it out** [**here**](https://replit.com/@LautaroOchotore/Probability-Calculator), to run it you have to be logged in and fork the project.
