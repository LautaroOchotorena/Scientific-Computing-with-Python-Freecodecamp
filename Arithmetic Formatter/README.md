# Arithmetic Formatter

The **objective** is to make an interfance when calculating a math operation.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Arithmetic%20Formatter/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**Arithmetic arranger**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Arithmetic%20Formatter/arithmetic_arranger.py) is where I did the work.

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Arithmetic%20Formatter/main.py) runs the **arithmetic file** and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Arithmetic%20Formatter/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.
