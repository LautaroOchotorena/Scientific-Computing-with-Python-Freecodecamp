# Time Calculator

The **objective** is to create a time calculator.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Time%20Calculator/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**Time calculator**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Time%20Calculator/time_calculator.py) is where I did the work.

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Time%20Calculator/main.py) runs the **time calculator file** and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Time%20Calculator/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.
